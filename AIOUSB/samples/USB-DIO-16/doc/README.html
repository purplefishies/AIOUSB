<h1>USB-DIO-16A Sample Program Release Notes</h1>
<p><a href="../../../../../doc/README.html">Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This directory contains several sample programs for the USB-DIO-16A which demonstrate use of different
features and libraries.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p><a href="#BasicAIOUSBSampleC">Basic AIOUSB Sample - sample.cpp, receiver.cpp</a></p>
	<li><p><a href="#AIOUSBJavaSample">AIOUSB Java Sample - Sample.java</a></p>
</ul>

<h2>Basic AIOUSB Sample</h2>
<p><a href="sample.cpp.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Sample.cpp</span></a> and
<a href="receiver.cpp.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">receiver.cpp</span></a> are a pair of
simple programs to demonstrate using the AIOUSB module to control an ACCES I/O model USB-DIO-16A digital
I/O board. The program is not intended to be a comprehensive demonstration and is limited to demonstrating
the following features of the AIOUSB API:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Initializing and shutting down the API – <span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Init()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">AIOUSB_Exit()</span></p>
	<li><p>Identifying devices on the USB bus – <span class="funcname">QueryDeviceInfo()</span></p>
	<li><p>Obtaining the serial number of a device on the bus – <span class="funcname">GetDeviceSerialNumber()</span></p>
	<li><p>Configuring the board – <span class="funcname">DIO_ConfigureEx()</span></p>
	<li><p>Writing to, and reading from a digital I/O stream – <span class="funcname">DIO_StreamSetClocks()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">DIO_StreamOpen()</span>, <span class="funcname">DIO_StreamFrame()</span>,
		<span class="funcname">DIO_StreamClose()</span></p>
</ul>
<p>For easy identification, the source code lines prefixed with the comment <span class="computer bold">/*API*/</span>
denote calls to the AIOUSB API.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>Before building the program, make sure the <a href="http://www.libusb.org/" target="_blank">libusb</a>
module is installed. Also refer to the comments at the top of <span class="filename">sample.cpp</span> for additional details.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that the ACCES I/O AIOUSB module is installed (<span class="italic">see
<a href="../../../doc/README.html">Installing And Using AIOUSB Library</a></span>).</p>
<p>The simplest way to build the sample program is to type <span class="computer bold italic">make</span> at the command line.
The sample program is the default target in <span class="filename">Makefile</span>. Optionally, one can manually compile the
program with the commands:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">g++ sample.cpp -laiousb -lusb-1.0 -o sample<br>
g++ receiver.cpp -laiousb -lusb-1.0 -o receiver</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>Before executing the sample program, make sure the Linux system is configured to automatically
detect ACCES I/O devices plugged into the USB bus and upload the appropriate firmware to those devices.
The files that support this automatic configuration have recently been updated and new documentation
prepared. Please refer to <a href="../../../../Firmware/doc/README.html">Configuring ACCES I/O USB Devices To Work Under Linux</a>
for details.</p>
<p>To execute the program, attach two USB-DIO-16A digital I/O boards to the USB bus and verify that their LEDs turn on, indicating
that firmware has been successfully uploaded to the boards. Then simply type <span class="computer bold italic">./sample</span>
at the command line. There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first two USB-DIO-16A
digital I/O boards on the USB bus. If the sample program fails to find two boards, it will print an error message and quit.
If it finds two such boards, the following output will appear:</p>
<pre class="computer output">USB-DIO-16A sample program version 1.9, 29 January 2010
  AIOUSB library version 1.88, 18 January 2010
  This program demonstrates high speed streaming between 2 USB-DIO-16A
  devices on the same USB bus. For simplicity, it uses the first 2 such
  devices found on the bus.
ACCES devices found:
  Device at index 0:
    Product ID: 0x800f
    Product name: USB-DIO-16A
    Number of digital I/O bytes: 4
    Number of counters: 0
  Device at index 1:
    Product ID: 0x800f
    Product name: USB-DIO-16A
    Number of digital I/O bytes: 4
    Number of counters: 0
Sending device at index 0, serial number 40e3a0d0c488856d
Receiving device at index 1, serial number 40e3a0d0a53149dd
Stream clock for device at index 0 set to 1000432.0 Hz
1024000 point frame successfully written to device at index 0
1024000 point frame successfully read from device at index 1</pre>
<p>The sample program prints out a list of all the ACCES devices found on the USB bus and then proceeds
to exercise the two USB-DIO-16A boards found. Basically, <span class="filename">sample</span> executes
<span class="filename">receiver</span> as a child process to receive the stream data from one of the two devices.
<span class="filename">Sample</span> then transmits the stream data to the other device. The entire demonstration
takes a couple of seconds.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Important:</span> this sample program requires that the two USB-DIO-16A devices be electrically
connected together so that one device can transmit to the other. This connection is accomplished by means of a standard
68-pin SCSI cable attached to the J1 connector of each device. Contact ACCES for more information or to purchase such a
cable (part number <a href="http://www.accesio.com/go.cgi?p=../cat/accessory.html#C68PS18L" target="_blank">C68PS18L</a>).</p>

<h2>AIOUSB Java Sample</h2>
<p><a href="Sample.java.html" target="_blank"><span class="filename">Sample.java</span></a> is a Java
implementation of the above sample program. It demonstrates use of the Java class library, which
utilizes the AIOUSB C-language library. Refer to
<a href="../../../java/doc/index.html">AIOUSB Java Class Library Reference</a> for detailed documentation
on the Java class library.</p>
<h3>Building</h3>
<p>The prerequisites for building <span class="filename">Sample.jar</span> are that the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a> must be installed. In addition,
the AIOUSB Java library (<span class="filename">aiousb.jar</span>) must be installed somewhere on your system.
To compile the program, either use the supplied <span class="filename">Makefile</span> or use the command:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">javac -cp ../../java/aiousb.jar Sample.java</p>
<h3>Executing</h3>
<p>Like the C-language sample program above, this Java sample program requires two USB-DIO-16A devices, hooked
together by means of a SCSI cable. The main difference between the Java program and the C program, aside from
the languages and libraries used, is that the Jave version is multithreaded, whereas the C program utilizes
two processes.</p>
<p>Assuming you have two USB-DIO-16A devices up and running (as indicated by their illuminated LEDs) and hooked
together by means of a SCSI cable, type the following command to execute the sample program:</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">java -jar Sample.jar</p>
<p>or</p>
<p class="computer bold indent1">java -cp ../../java/aiousb.jar:. Sample</p>
<p>There are no command line arguments to worry about. The program will search for the first two USB-DIO-16A devices
on the USB bus. If it fails to find such a board, it will print an error message and quit. If it finds two such
devices, the following output will appear:</p>
<pre class="computer output">USB-DIO-16A sample program version: 1.3, 29 January 2010
  AIOUSB Java library version: 1.7, 18 January 2010
  AIOUSB library version: 1.88, 18 January 2010
  JRE version: 1.6.0_17
  OS version: Linux amd64 2.6.31.5-0.1-custom
